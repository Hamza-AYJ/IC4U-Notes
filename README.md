<h4>Arrays, Matrices and Pixels </h4>

Def: A pixel is a 2 list from natural numbers, define a position. 

a= [3,4]  and b = [73,73] are pixels

Note that 0 is not officially a natural number, so the smallest pixel is [1,1]

Def: A pixel of form [n,n] is diagonal
Def: for a pixel a = [m,n] is transpose
Is aT= [n,m] Pix

Pixels are a 2D version of natural numbers (1 2 3 4 5…)

Def: A maxel is a multiset of pixels

Ex. m = [ [1,1] [1,3] [2,2] [1,3] [2,4] [2,4] ]

Can be visualized by recording its multiplicities on the screen

Matrix is just a picture of a maxel
